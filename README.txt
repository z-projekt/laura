laura is discordapp bot written in TypeScript
created to administrate z projekt server.

as a moderation tool, laura does not allow regular users
to interact with her, you have to provide discord rank identificator
in config.json thereby allowing users having following rank 
to do initially forbidden things mentioned above.

note: there is no point to store per server informations in database
      since laura is designed to moderate one server. if you want to do so,
      fork the project and integrate it with database.
